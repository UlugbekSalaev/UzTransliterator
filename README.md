# UzTranslit | State-of-the-art machine transliteration tool for Uzbek language, Cyrillic<>Latin<>NewLatin

Machine transliteration defined in this project is a process of automatically transforming written script of
words from a source alphabet into words of another target alphabet within the same language, while
preserving their meaning, as well as pronunciation. The main goal of this project is to present a state-of-
the-art machine transliteration tool between three common scripts used in low-resource Uzbek language:
old Cyrillic, currently official Latin, and newly announced New-Latin alphabets, which was created using
a combination of rule-based and statistical approaches. Github source: https://github.com/UlugbekSalaev/UzTranslit
