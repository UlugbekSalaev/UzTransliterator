  <h3 align="center">UzTranslit | State-of-the-art machine transliteration tool for Uzbek language, Cyrillic<>Latin<>NewLatin</h3>
  <p align="center">
    The main goal of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art machine transliteration tool between three common scripts used in low-resource Uzbek language: old Cyrillic, currently official Latin, and newly announced New-Latin alphabets, which was created using a combination of rule-based and statistical approaches. The created tool is available as an open-source Python package, as well as a web-based application including a public API

Feel free to use the tool presented in this project, and if you find it useful, plese make sure to cite the paper [here](...) (coming soon...)
Demo of the web-based transliteration tool can be seen [here](https://nlp.urdu.uz/?menu=translit).


In this paper, we presented a Python code, a web tool, and an API created for the Uzbek language that performs machine transliteration between two popularly used Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, as well as a newly reformed version of the Latin alphabet, which, according to the governmental decree, all legal texts will have been completely adapted to by year 2023.
